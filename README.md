## Project Overview

This project explores the application of advanced deep learning models, such as LSTM networks and Transformer models, along with seasonal methods, to forecast tidal levels across various Hawaiian islands. The goal is to create a robust predictive model to understand and forecast tidal features like the highest tide, mean sea level (MSL), and lowest tide.

Understanding these patterns is crucial for:
- Coastal management
- Climate impact assessments
- Environmental monitoring

The forecasted results aim to support decision-making for coastal infrastructure planning, flood risk management, and studying the effects of climate change on sea levels.

## Modeling Techniques

### Hybrid ARIMA + LSTM Model
- **ARIMA**: Utilized to capture linear trends and seasonal components in the time series data.
- **LSTM**: Applied to model non-linear, complex patterns, particularly in the residuals from ARIMA, which allows for accurate short- and long-term predictions.

### Hybrid Fourier + SARIMA Model
- **Fourier Series**: Employed to capture the cyclical, seasonal patterns in tidal data.
- **SARIMA**: Used to refine predictions by addressing residual patterns and irregular short-term fluctuations not captured by Fourier components.
